# Solar Radiation Prediction
**Introduction**

Solar radiation is the Earth's primary source of energy and has an important role in the surface radiation balance, hydrological cycles, vegetation photosynthesis, and weather and climate extremes. The accurate prediction of solar radiation is therefore very important in both the solar industry and climate research.
Solar radiation prediction has a great importance in electricity generation from solar energy and helps to size photovoltaic power systems. 

**Purpose**

Future forecasts of solar irradiance can be beneficial to estimating how much energy might be generated from  solar power generator in days, weeks, or even months.
This is useful in managing power distribution from different kinds of sources.  The project makes use of SQL Queries, Pandas, and matplotlib Libraries.

**About the dataset**
This file provides details about Solar Radiation Level. Various factors like temperature, wind speed, humidity and pressure affect the solar radiation level. 
Our DATASET has 11 predictor variables and 32686 instances to predict the **target** variable(**Radiation**).Description of this dataset can be viewed on the Kaggle website,
where the data was obtained (https://www.kaggle.com/dronio/SolarEnergy)

**Questions**

Here we try to analyze IPL dataset and answer Questions as below.

1)Predict Solar Radiation Level

2)Finding Corelation between Temperature and Radiation

3)Finding effects of different factors such as humidity, pressure, wind etc on Radiation

4)Understanding the solar radiation levels in different months.
